# this changes how often the screen is refreshed.  Lowering it will

# changing ips can lead to dramatically different performance.  It
# also affects how quickly time passes in the emulated machine.
# Setting it too low can cause clock interrupts to happen too rapidly.
# Setting it too high will make the whole machine feel sluggish.
# (Note: with using clock sync=realtime, the ips parameter is not
# really used, although it is still used for vga updates)

# This means that time in the emulated machine is the same as
# realtime.  This can be scary because running the same simulation
# twice in a row can lead to different results (because they started
# at different times, for instance).  If you want to use non-real
# time, then use sync=none.
